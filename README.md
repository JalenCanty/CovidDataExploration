# Covid Data Exploration

## Introduction
This project involved exploring COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau. The primary objective of this project was to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries.

The data was sourced from the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), then was cleasned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL to extract relevant information such as the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
