# Covid Data Exploration

## Introduction
This project involved exploring COVID-19 data using SQL and visualizing the results in Tableau. The primary objective of this project was to gain insights into the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and countries.

The data was sourced from the website [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths), then was cleasned, transformed, and analyzed using SQL to extract relevant information such as the number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

## Visualizations
After analysis, the data was then loaded into Tableau, where various visualizations were created to represent the findings. These visualizations include charts, graphs, maps, and dashboards that helped to visualize trends, patterns, and insights in the data.

## Conclusion
According to the data, Europe was the continent most impacted by COVID-19. It had the highest number of total deaths, while the United Kingdom had the highest percentage of population infected. It is projected that by 2024, approximately 38% of the population in both the United Kingdom and the United States will have been infected by the virus.

The project's results provided a better understanding of the pandemic's spread and the most affected countries, & continents. This information is helpful in decision-making for policymakers, health experts, and the public, informing them on the best ways to respond to the pandemic.
